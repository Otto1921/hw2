%% assignment 1 Population growth 
% a) Create a row vector `population` with this data.
% b) Calculate the year-over-year growth rate and store it in a new vector `growth_rate`.
% c) Create a 2x5 matrix `pop_data` where the first row is the `population` vector and the second row is the `growth_rate` vector.
% d)use fprintf to print a formatted table showing each years population
% growth rate 
% the population was over 5 years the data was 5000, 5200, 5350, 5600, 5800

% A small town has recorded its population over the last 5 years. The data for each year is: [5000, 5200, 5350, 5600, 5800].

% a) Create a row vector `population` with this data.
population = [5000 5200 5350 5600 5800];
% b) Calculate the year-over-year growth rate and store it in a new vector `growth_rate`.

growth_rate = (population(2:end) - population(1:end-1)) %./ population(1:end-1);


% c) Create a 2x5 matrix `pop_data` where the first row is the `population` vector and the second row is the `growth_rate` vector.
pop_data = [population; [0 growth_rate]]


% d) Use `fprintf` to print a formatted table showing each year's population and growth rate.

%  FOr year 1 the population was 5000 and hte growth rate was 0
for i=1:length(population)
  
    fprintf('the year is %d the population was %d the growth was %f \n', i, pop_data(1, i), pop_data(2, i))
%end
